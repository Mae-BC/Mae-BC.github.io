  Discuss a time where you were blocked by a simple problem:

<p class="PS-text">
  The kata we did this week had a simple question that I got stuck on. It was asking us to the average from a array.
  I used google and asking for hints from coaches to help me solve it. I was pretty frustrating at first but once I had solved it 
  it was the best feeling ever. It helped me understand for() loops better

  Elegantly solved a problem:

<p class="PS-text">
  The fizzbuzz problem wasn't what I would call "Elegantly solved" but I'm proud of it none the less.
  I completed the first portion pretty fast but was completely stumped for the second part. I used google, trying stuff and eventually asking coaches for help.
  This question really drove home the need to ask for help. I dont think I would have solved it on my own, regardless of how much time I spent on google.

  How confident are you with each of these problem solving techniques?
</p>

<p class="PS-text">
<ul>
  <li>Pseudocode: 4/10 - I am okay but I have a bad habit of not breaking it down, just repeating the instructions.</li>
  <li>Trying something: 7/10 - This is my go too, however if I dont understand what I'm doing it can make me frustrated faster</li>
  <li>Rubber duck method: 8/10 - Im all about this one. Do I look crazy talking to myself? Yes. Does it help? Also yes, and thats all that matters.</li>
  <li>Reading error messages: 5/10 - This one is right down the middle. I find that constant error messages make me frustrated faster, especially if I dont understand what they are saying. On the other hand, they can be super helpful.</li>
  <li>Console.log: 8/10 - I like this one alot and use it pretty often</li>
  <li>Googling: 9/10 - This on is my go to after console.logging and rubber ducky dont work.</li>
  <li>Asking peers for help: -10000/10 - I get anxious about asking my peers for help. I dont want to pull anyone else from their work just to help me. Plus its hard not to compare myself to other people and it feels like when I ask them for help im admitting that I'm lesser. Logically I understand that we are all learning and everyone has their own learninig style/strengths/limitations etc but logic doesn't always beat emotions. </li>
  <li>Asking coaches for help: 6/10 - Im a lot more comfortable with this now then I was at the start of the week. </li>
  <li>Improving your process with reflection: 4/10 - im not too great at reflection, but im working on it.</li>
</ul>

<p class="section-headings">
  Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Why? What will you try next time?
</p>
</p class="PS-text">
At the start of this week I was super reluctant to ask for help due to the reasons listed above. Obvouisly struggling on the same questions for over a day wasn't helping anyone so I eventually caved and asked for help. 
Next time i'll make sure it doesn't take me that long to ask.
