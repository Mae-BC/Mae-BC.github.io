      What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      My long term goal is still the same as foundations. I want a career that I
      enjoy where I can program and problem solve reguarly.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      What do you think your biggest strengths and limitations will be in
      Bootcamp?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      My biggest strength will be my determination. I know bootcamp will be hard
      but I will make it though. A limitaion would be my learning style
      sometimes requires things to be explained rather thoroughly before I can
      truely understand it. This tend to slow me down a little.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      What do you think your biggest non-technical challenge at Bootcamp will
      be?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      Remembering to treat myself with care. I tend to be overly self-critical
      and It can hurt my self-esteem. This leads to frustration and anger when
      solving problems becuase I feel like I am behind or should already
      understand something.

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      What non-technical skills - human skills - would you like to see developed
      in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      I need to get better at working with other people. I tend to be very quiet
      and struggle to contribute. I think that bootcamp will kick that habit out
      of me due to the weekly group projects
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      What are your expectations from the bootcamp team?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      Just keep doing what your doing. Providing a supportive space to learn
      wihout judgement and materials to better help out learning journy along
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      What are your expectations of yourself during bootcamp?
    </h3>
    <p class="LP-text">
      To put everything I have into my learning. I want to make sure Im
      following my hauroa plan and taking care of myself so that I can get the
      abosulute most out of my time here. Most importantly though I need to
      remeber not to beat myself up too much.

      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning.
    </h3>

    <p class="LP-text">
      I think academically my strengths are my determination and curiosity. I am
      curious about anything that interests me which often leads me to self
      directed study. When stuck on a problem due to my curiosity my
      determination is what pushes me through.

      What skills (non-technical core/human skills) would you like to see
      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h3>

    <p class="LP-text">
      I have worked with people since I joined the work force at 14. I have
      worked with people with many different backgrounds and personality types
      and have managed teams. I can communicate effectivily and am comfortable
      with large groups on a surface level but I really struggle to read peoples
      emotions. I want to get better at reading and understanding other peoples
      emotions in a professonal sense. I really struggle to understand how
      others are feeling unless they tell me, especially via video or chat
      because I cant read their body language. Also I want to get better at
      asking for help. This something I have always struggled with.

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This
      should include: An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work
      productively and safely with other learners, Facilitators and
      industry/community representatives.

    <p class="LP-text">
      I have decided that my "work day" during my studies will be a typical 9-5
      with the occassional overtime and work staurdays. Before starting
      foundations I worked out my daily routine and I plan to stick to it.
      Should the "occassional" overtime become an everyday thing I will
      reevalute my routine to avoid burnout but so far it has been smooth
      sailing.

      What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you.
    </h3>

    <p class="LP-text">
      I have regular check-ins with my friends and family and sundays are
      strictly reserved for rest to avoid burnout. Should things become too much
      I will use my regular problem solving to reevalute my schedual, mental
      heath and workload. Then decide I how to fix/manage whatever issue I may
      be having.
    </p>

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.
    </h3>

    <p class="LP-text">
      My regular problem solving process usually gets me through but if I cant
      figure it out in less then an hour then I will move onto asking for help
      from the Facilitation team and fellow students.

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      A description of what you expect from the Facilitation team.

    <p class="LP-text">
      Just being willing and able to help. Patience with us and acceptting of
      the fact that we are going to make mistakes. Which already seems to be the
      case.

    <h3 class="sub-heading">
      Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed
      to other things. For example, you might have whƒÅnau commitments like
      school drop-offs. It's important to plan these in.

    <p class="LP-text">
      I have regualar check-ins with friends and family but these can be
      arranged for the weekends or evenings.
