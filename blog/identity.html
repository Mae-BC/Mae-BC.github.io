      <p div class="inden-text1">
        I want to preface this post by saying I've never examined my own
        motivations, values and identity so thoroughly before this task.
        <br />
        I mean, sure I've done the odd buzzfeed quiz, who hasn't? Anyone who
        claims they haven't wondered what hogwart house they'd be in are
        liars.
        <br />
        I found that when posed with seemingly simple questions I was
        momentarlly stumped.
        <br />
        What were my values? Ethics? Strengths and limitations?
        <br />
        Afters some deliberation and online personilty tests, I think ive
        finally been able to translate my erratic thoughts into something
        coherent.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p div class="inden-text2">
        I have managed to narrow down my values to what I think is most
        important to me and to the values that make the foundations of who I
        am. My first -and in my opinion most important- value is self respect.
        If you cant respect yourself for your past struggles, personality and
        attitude toward life then who can? If you can see your own value then
        others will too. I think that we should all be our biggest supports
        and cheerleaders, as hard as that can be. Dont get me wrong,
        respecting yourself isnt about being happy and confident 24/7.
        Everyone has bad days but self respect also encompassess self love.
        Being able to forgive yourself for not being 100% is essential to this
        value and-in my opinion- a happier life.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p div class="inden-text3">
        The next value I have decided to discus is aiming for meaningful work
        and social interactions.
        <br />
        I think that being aware of the work that your putting into the world
        is crucial. Everything you do reflects on you as a person and will
        effect people, regardless of your intentions.
        <br />
        The same is said for social interactions. Everything you say and do
        can and will have an effect on someone and with the power of
        technology that is even more true. We can ruin or make someones day
        from the otherside of the world in seconds.
        <br />
        Everyone has different sensitivities but I think this value can
        implemented simply by being mindful of what your doing and its
        effects.
      </p>
    </div>

      <p div class="inden-text4">
        These values have developed throughout my life, and I belive one of
        the biggest influences have been my culture and the people around me.
        <br />
        Growing up I felt like an outsider looking in when it comes to my
        culture. I never learned much about the Maori culture or my personal
        family history. It didnt bother me at the time, however as I get older
        I keep finding myself wondering what would have changed had I been
        more intergrated from a young age. Would I form stronger connections
        to people? Understand emotions better? I am almost painfully
        independent, take a little longer to interpret emotions and I struggle
        to make and maintain connections, I assume as a result of limited
        cultral connection. My independance, self-reliance and general
        stubborness could be attributed to social influences while growing up.

        When considering my ethics the first thing that came to mind was a
        situation at my old job a few years ago. I was a duty manager at the
        time and two of my staff members where having a rather heated
        arguement.
        <br />
        I dont remember the exact details anymore as this was a few years ago
        but one person was accusing the other of stealing a phone. The accused
        staff member had been working with us longer than the accuser so my
        knee-jeck reaction was to think the accussser was wrong.
        <br />
        I wanted to defend the accused. However I stayed impartial, we checked
        the accused staff members belongings and once we found out the accuser
        was wrong, he was made to apologize. Turns out it was dropped behind a
        freezer. This particular exchange comes to mind because despite
        wanting to defend someone I knew well, without evidence I ethically
        couldn't appose the accuser. I had to put my feelings and instincts on
        the backburner. Looking back, I think I did the right thing. I did
        upset the accused staff member slightly because I didn't immediately
        take their side but I personally think fairness and reamining
        impartial in a situation like this is more important that an
        indivduals feelings.

        Another example of a tension filled situation was between myself and a
        another student on my construction course. We disagreed on the proper
        way to fix a weatherboard to the house we were building. At the time
        we just asked the tutor and the problem was solved but looking back I
        wish I had handled that differently like talking through it,
        explaining my reasonings or go over the plans together to determine
        the installation requirements. I believe it would have been more
        beneficial to our learning.

        My strengths are my sheer determination and a thirst for knowledge.
        <br />
        My determination has pulled me through tough spots in my life and has
        enabled me to over come countless obstacles My thirst for knowledge
        has directed my life for as long as I can rememeber These traits,
        togther make me able and eager to explore new topics of intrest
        frequently and reach my goals regardless of things getting in my way.
        <br />
        My limitations are needing to cover topics multiple times in detail
        before I really understand them and my independance.
        <br />
        While my need to go over topics doesn't bother me it does mean I need
        to prepare and allocate time outside of class to personally revise.
        Sometimes when I really struggle I need to have subjects explained a
        different way which can cause problems with self study. My
        independance is a strength in my personal life but academicly I
        consider it a limitation as it makes me feel like I cant ask for help
        when I need to, as well as the general struggle to connect with
        classmates and tutors.
