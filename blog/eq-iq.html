      Emotional intelligence (EI/EQ) is defined as the ability to perceive, use,
      understand, manage, and handle emotions.
      <br />
      People with high emotional intelligence can recognize their own emotions
      and those of others, use emotional information to guide thinking and
      behavior, discern between different feelings and label them appropriately,
      and adjust emotions to adapt to environments.

      What’s the difference between IQ and EQ? 
      <br>
      Your IQ usually refers to your
      intellectual ability. Some of the most common elements of your IQ include
      your ability to: use logic to solve problems plan and strategize
      understand abstract ideas learn and adapt to change grasp and use
      language.
      <br />
      Your emotional quotient (EQ) generally refers to your ability to sense
      emotion in yourself and in other people. It also refers to how you use
      that awareness to guide your behavior.
    </p>

    <p div class="EI-text"> 
      
      In general, if you have a high EQ, you may find it easier to:
    <ul class="EI-text">
    
   <li>Identify emotions in yourself and others</li>

   <li>empathize with other people</li>
    
   <li>adapt your feelings and behavior to different situations</li>

   <li>control your impulses</li>

   <li>withstand temptations and delay gratification </li>

    <li>resolve conflicts with others</li>

    <li>communicate effectively</li>
    
    </ul> 
    </p>

   <p div class="EI-text"> 
    Emotional intelligence (EI) forms the juncture at
    which cognition and emotion meet. Emotional intelligence can lead us on the path to a
    fulfilled and happy life by providing a framework through which to apply
    standards of intelligence to emotional responses and understand that these
    responses may be logically consistent or inconsistent with particular
    beliefs about emotion. As the workplace evolves, so too does the body of
    research supporting that individuals (from interns to managers) with higher
    EI are better equipped to work cohesively within teams, deal with change
    more effectively, and manage stress – thus enabling them to more efficiently
    pursue business objectives.
