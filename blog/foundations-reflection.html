      What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due
      to the core learning?
    </p>
    <p class="PS-text">
      I spent a long time journalling and researching personality types for the
      indentity and values core excersise. While it didn't necessarily teach me
      anything I didnt already know it did help me undersand some parts of
      myself better. Ive always had trouble asking for help and while I've
      acknowledged that about myself for a while I had never thought about
      <em>why</em> I was that way. I've learned that this stems from my
      independance which is a byproduct of my up bringing. The importance that I
      have put into not relying on others for the majority of my life has
      effected my comfort levels around asking for help. I think understanding
      this was huge for me. Knowing that I can ask for help without that
      equating to relying on someone (and therefore going against an integral
      part of myself) has been a weight off my shoulders not just in foundations
      but in my personal life as well. <br />
      <br />
      I think another thing I learned about myself is I respond to blocks
      andcuriosity problems better when I approach the problem curiosity and
      even a sence of humor. This lesson more came from the tech but I belive it
      also plays in to one of my core values of self repect. Often throughout
      foundations I would become dissapointed and almost angry with myself if I
      didn't understand something quickly. When I started being mindful of how I
      was treating myself and tackling problems from a healther angle I had a
      lot more fun and tended to get through problems a little easier. <br />
      <br />
      That last point also works for my imposter syndrome. Going into
      foundations I knew I would struggle with this, and I did. Imposter
      syndrome was a massive problem for me until I examined where it was coming
      from (my own way of thinking). Even though I still struggle with this
      every once in a while I find it much easier to deal with since I started
      being more mindful of what I saying about myself and my general attitude
      towards learning.

      What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
      programming?
    </p>
    <p class="PS-text">
      Despite the stereotypes, professional programming is very social. Having
      strong social skills and emotional intelligence (EQ) is a key part of the
      job. Using empathy, self-awareness and core values in the work place means
      you can better understand your team, their point of views and solutions to
      problems. Using these characteristics is essential for professional growth
      and a cooprative, efficent and happy work space.

      What has surprised you the most about the core learning? What were the
      most challenging aspects of the core learning?
    </p>
    <p class="PS-text">
      Its necessity. While I understood that you need at least basic EQ to work
      anywhere I didnt exactly understand <em>how</em> important it would be and
      how thoroughly it would be covered. In hindsite it makes sence and is
      rather obvious. <br />
      <br />
      In terms of challenging, self reflection was pretty difficult for me. The
      indentiy and values in particular but also basic reflections could be a
      struggle some weeks.

    <p class="section-headings">
      Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
      focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
    </p>
    <p class="PS-text">
      It is fundamental to have these skills not just to work well with others
      as mention previously but to propel ourselves foward. The IT industry is
      forever expanding and shifting, we need to be able to change with it.
      Becoming stagnant will leave you behind and the ablity to understand
      yourself and your learning abilities will enable you to better yourself.

    <p class="section-headings">
      Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
      time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead?
      Justify your answer.
    </p>
    <p class="PS-text">
      If the rest of this post has failed to nail home my opnion of the
      importance of the core learning then let me lay it out: The core is
      essential, and in some cases more important then the tech side of this
      course. I could spend an additional hour memorizing syntax or I could use
      that time to reflect on my learning from that day. The things i did wrong,
      the things i did right, my attitude to problems and how I can improve it.
      All of these this are core and in my humble opinion are much more
      important to understand and work on then syntax that I could look up in 10
      seconds.
