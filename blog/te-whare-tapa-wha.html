    <p class="section-headings">Taha Tinana (Physical Wellbeing)</p>
    <p class="tapa-text">
      Taha tinana is your physical wellbeing. It is about how your body grows,
      feels and moves, and how you care for it. <br />
      <br />
      My Taha Tinana Activties: <br />
      <br />
      - Taking small walks around my neighbourhood in the evenings before it
      gets dark everyday. <br />

      - Yoga in the morning and during my study breaks <br />
      - Eating well <br />
      <br />
    </p>

    <p class="section-headings">Taha Whānau (Family Wellbeing)</p>
    <p class="tapa-text">
      Taha whānau is about who makes you feel like you belong, who you care
      about and who you share your life with. <br />
      <br />
      My Taha Whānau Activties: <br />
      <br />

    <p class="section-headings">
      Taha Hinengaro (Emotional and Mental Wellbeing)
    </p>
    <p class="tapa-text">
      Taha hinengaro is your mind, heart, conscience, thoughts and feelings.
      It’s about how you feel, as well as how you communicate and think. <br />
      <br />
      My Taha Hinengaro Activties: <br />

      - Talking to my friends as often as possible <br />

    <p class="section-headings">Taha Wairua (Spiritual Wellbeing)</p>
    <p class="tapa-text">
      The way people view wairua can be very different. For some, wairua is the
      capacity for faith or religious beliefs or having a belief in a higher
      power. For others, wairua is an internal connection to the universe or the
      sacred. There is no right or wrong way to think of or experience wairua,
      but it is an important part of your mental wellbeing. <br />
      <br />
      My Taha Wairua Activties: <br />
      <br />
      - Yoga <br />
      - Eating Well <br />
      - Connecting with nature <br />
      <br />

    <p class="section-headings">
      Whenua (Interconnections to the land and environment)
    </p>
    <p class="tapa-text">
      As the foundation for the other 4 dimensions, the health of the land and
      the natural environment is strongly connected to your health and
      wellbeing. You can think about whenua as your place of belonging. For
      Māori, the whenua is a key part of identity. <br />
      <br />
      My Whenua Activties: <br />
      <br />
      - Yoga <br />
      - Gardening <br />
      - Laying in grass, sun bathing <br />
      - Listening to the birds
