      When I was first intoduced to the terms 'margin' and 'padding' I really struggled to differentiate the two. 
      They do similar jobs but still differ signifcantly. In this post I'm going to go over their differences as a way to 
      cement the information in my head.  
    </p>
    <p div class="MvP-text2">
    There are a few key terms in here that I think are important to understand. 
  </div>
  
  <ul div class="MvP-list">
        <li>Element- an element in CSS is an object. It could be anything from an image to a paragraph tag. The elements are the things being manipulated with CSS</li>
        <li>Property- a property is a charcteristic -like colour, font size or margin- that changes how something is displayed on the webpage. </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        
    </p>
  </div>

    I want to explore margins first. A Margin is the area <em>around</em> your element.
    I like to think of them as force fields. Margins "push away" from other elements on the webpage to leave a space between them. 
    Margins can be useful for setting up equal spacing between elements or making sure the edges of your webpage are clear.

  <p div class="MvP-text1"> 
      Above is what I mean by margins acting like force fields. The arrows kind of demonstrate the "pushing".
      The arrows also tell us that there will be at least 10 pixels of space between this element and any adjacent elements. 
      This is indicated by the "10px" they've been labelled with.
</p>

<p div class="MvP-text1">
On the other hand we have padding. Padding is located <em>inside</em> the border of the element. 
Essentially padding beefs up the space between the element and the elements border. 
Padding is typically used to change an elements size.

alt="example image padding" height="300" width="300">


<p div class="MvP-text5">
The difference has been clarified but how do you actually code these changes? 
Here are some examples:

<p div class="MvP-text1">
You can see in this example the margin property has been specified to left and right. While this one way of getting the job done 
you can also use the basic margin property and simply list the margins. Margins are listed in a clockwise direction eg. top, right, bottom, left.
</p>

<p div class="MvP-text1">
   The padding property in the second image is set to 70px. As mentioned before this means that the element size will change to accommodate
