    Describe how understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits
    people.
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    Understanding the principles of neuroplasticity and how it works is
    massively beneficial. Neuroplasticity shows us that our intelligence is not
    static, whether that is IQ or EQ. With that knowledge we are able to improve
    both of those areas of our self. That is true for every part of our brain.
    All most everything that we do can be improved and strengthened by training
    nuero pathways.
  </p>

  <p class="section-headings">
    Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your
    benefit.
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    I have trying to use neuroplasticity to my advantage with learning code. I
    have been trying to code everyday so that my nuerons are strengthened and
    likely to fire together when repeating the same actions the next day
  </p>

  <p class="section-headings">
    What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    Neuroplasticity is all about learning and practicing actions so the best
    ways to improve would be doing just that. Things like learning a new
    language, creating art and reading can be great ways to improve. Stimulating
    your brain is key here. Anything that gets your neurons working can be
    beneficial. Rest is also vital. Just like your body after pyshical exersize
    your brain needs rest after strengthening your neuroplasticity.

    Growth Mindset: Discuss what it is and why it is relevant.
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    "A growth mindset, as conceived by Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck and
    colleagues, is the belief that a person's capacities and talents can be
    improved over time." The growth mindset is goes hand in hand with
    neuroplasticity. You can understand everything there is to know about
    neuroplasticity and how it effects you and your brain but without a growth
    mindset that is worth nothing. A growth mindset reminds us that we always
    have room to grow and learn. We need that if we want to improve in any area
    of our lives.

    In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    During the pre-curriculum section of foundations I touched on this subject.
    Doing this exploration its really cemented the importance of having a growth
    midset and practicing skills.
  </p>

  <p class="section-headings">
    How will you integrate growth mindset into your learning journey?
  </p>

  <p class="neu-text">
    I think just being aware that I can and will grow into this information is
    important. I need to have patience with myself and try not to get frustrated
    when I don't understand something. I will learn I just need to keep going.

    Reflect and discuss how these understandings may shape or influence your
    learning plan and strategy.
  </p>
  <p class="neu-text">
    I dont think this will change my learning plan much. I already had
    neuroplasticity and a growth mindset in mind when creating my learning plan.
    I do, however need to practice a bit more mindfulness which is apart of
    strengthening neuroplasticity.
