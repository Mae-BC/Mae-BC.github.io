<h3>Howdy! My name is Mae</h3>
<h1>Welcome To My Blog</h1>
<h3>A Bit Of Context</h3>
<p>My name is Mae, and I’ve made 
  this blog to record my progress
  and work during my studies in 
  Dev Academy’s full stack web
  development boot camp. 
  </p>

  <p>
  I chose to do this course due
  to it’s focus on “human skills”.
  </p>
  <p>
  I’m aiming for a  
  career in this field
  and this blog 
  enables me to 
  practice essential
  skills.

<h3>Things I’m Thinking About at Any Given Time</h3>

<ul>
  <li><em>The</em> Sonic. You know the one.</li>
  <li>How many chickens could I take in a fight. Its 7.</li>
  <li>A birds reaction to skydivers.</li>
  <li>I fully believe I could hug a bear. Sure, I would die but I could get my arms around 'em first.</li>
  <li>I would rather drop dead then eat capsicum.</li>
</ul>
